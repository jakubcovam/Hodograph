# Hodograph

Python script for creating a hodograph, which is a diagram representing the movement of a fluid. It is also called a **velocity diagram**.



User can enter a set of wind speeds [m/s] and directions [degrees] at individual heights that will be plotted in the final image. A sample of the output is in the hodograph_points.png file and looks like this:

If you only need a blank diagram with no measurements shown, comment out lines 56 and 59 in the main.py. The obtained output will then looks like this:
